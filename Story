                          *** Story ***
 On a hot day of summer, an ant was searching for some water. 
 After walking around for some time, she came near the river. 
 To drink the water, she climbed up on a small rock. While trying
  to drink a water, she slipped and fell into the river.

There was a dove sitting on a branch of a tree who saw an ant
falling into the river. The dove quickly plucked a leaf and 
dropped it into the river near the struggling ant. The ant moved
towards the leaf and climbed up onto it. Soon, the leaf drifted
to dry ground, and the ant jumped out. She looked up to the
tree and thanked the dove.

Later, the same day, a bird catcher nearby was about to throw his
net over the dove hoping to trap it. An ant saw him and guessed
what he was about to do. The dove was resting and he had no idea
about the bird catcher. An ant quickly bit him on the foot.
Feeling the pain, the bird catcher dropped his net and let out
a light scream. The dove noticed it and quickly flew away.

Moral:  If you do good, good will come to you.  One good turn 
deserves another.
